            8/20/23 - Today we did a project where we split the class in half and we all had cut in half pvc pipes.
            we had to stand together and hold together the pvc pipes in a line. We then rolled a marble down the line 
            and tried to get it about 20 feet then into a small plactic container. we had about 16 people, but ony 8 pipes
            so 8 people would line up with their pipes and once the marble rolled past their pipe, they would hand it to 
            somone that didnt have a pvc pipe so they could get in the line and help the marble roll to the container.
            If the marble stopped or rolled backwards, we would have to start over again. When the class got split in half,
            It meant that the 2 halves were 2 different teams and the first team to get the marble in the container wins.

            week 2 8/28 9/1
            This week we learned about how to use tinkercad, and about mechanical engineering. I like tinckercad so far.
            I think its fun to use 3d modeling and be able to create anything. We also started our home appliance or 
            furinature project, where we are gonna make a home appliance/furinature in tinkercad. We leared more about mechanical 
            engineering and how it works. We also started making our rube goldberg machine in tinkercad.
        </p>

           week 3 9/5 9/8
           This week we worked on making a 3d model of a home appliance or furnature. I was thinking about making a fridge,
           but after a little tie working on it i didnt feel like making a fridge anymore. I then decided to make a couch.
           i started by placing a 3d rectanle, then cutting off some of it to give it a couch shape. I then shaved or the 
           corners of the couch to make it smooth and not sharp and blocky. I then used some math to divide the length of
           the seat area of the couch by 3 to know how long to make the couch cusions. I made the cusions then lifted everything
           up a little and added the legs. I then colored it a lightish brown and was done.

           week 4 9/11 9/15
           This week we worked on a rube goldberg machine. We started in tinkercad, making a draft of what we wanted to make. 
           The goal was to roll a baseball and have it end up popping a balloon. We started with rolling a baseball down 
           a ramp, then it curves then hits a mini car that rolls down a ramp, then stops on a tilting scale. Once it hits 
           the scale, the other side goes up wich has a needle on it wich pops a balloon. then we made it out of cardboard 
           and tested it and it worked.
       </p>

           week 5 9/18 9/22
           This week we did 2 different engeneering challenges. The first one we did was we got one peice of paper anc had 
           to make a boat with it. We could fold the paper however we wanted. We aslo could use tape but only a litle. I 
           made mine into a box type of shape. I taped the corners so no water could leak in.
       </p>

           Week 6 9/25 9/29
           this week we got to dissect a computer. We worked with out partner to take apart all the peices of a computer and
           then put it back together. My partner and I took turns taking parts off of the computer until there wasnt anything
           indide it. We got to see how the computer worked and what it looked like inside. We then had to put it back together 
           and test if it worked but ours didnt.
       </p>

           Week 7 10/2 10/6
           This week we worked on making a prosthetic arm out of cardboard that can grab an empty water bottle. My partner and
           I made one that has a spot to put your arm, but then extends farther than your actual arm to grab things. It had strings
           on its fingertips that made the had contracts. The strings acted like tendons in a hand. We also put little peices of
           cardboard down the finger to hold the strings in place, ours ended up working, and we were able to grab the bottle.
           Then we also made a 3d model of a prosthetic for an animal. I made a sharks fin. I researched how prosthetics attached
           and what a shark fin prosthetic would look like
       </p>

           week 8 10/9 10/13
           this week we learned about areospace engineering. We learned about all the types of careers you can have that involve
           areospace engineering. It involves aircraft, spacecraft, missles, and rockets. We also learned about the 4 focuses on
           aircraft and rockets. We also learned about different companys that involve areospace engeneering like nasa and spacex.
       </p>

           week 9 10/16 10/20
           This week we worked on making a bottle rocket. First, we made a model for the rocket on tinkercad. After we did that, 
           we brought it to life and made it with actual soda bottles. We used hot glue and tape to secure wings we cut out of
           cardboard to our bottle. We then went to the upper feild and launched the rockets. Mine went pretty far, farther than
           alot of peoples.I didnt ue that much water, about a half a cup. I used about 60-65 for the pressure.If I could do
           something differenty, I would make it more plane like instead of rocket like.
       </p>
       <p>
           Week 10 10/23 10/27
           This week we learned about enviornmental engineering. We learned about water quality, hazardous materials, noise and
           light pollution, and more. we also did a water clarifiaction project, where we got a cut in half bottle and could choose
           what order to put big rocks, pebbles, sand, and cotton balls. Then we poured in very dirty water and saw how clean we
           could make the water. We then took the filtered water and put it through thte filter agoin to clean it as much as possible.
           My groups water turned out pretty clean. We chose to have cotton balls first, then sand, then pebbles, then rocks.

           week 11 10/30 11/3
           This week we learned about electrical engeneering. We learned about power supplies, resistors, compasitors, and more. we 
           made circuts in tinkercad that make a led light up. we did a few different circus that would make different leds light up 
           in different ways. we used different power supplies and resitors that we learned about to make the leds light up.
       </p>
       <p>
           Week 12 11/6 11/10
           This wek we worked on lab 3 and 4. It was like week 11 but this time instead of ln a website, we did them in real life.
           We used breadboards and hooked up wires to them. We also used leds and made them light up. We used the leds and arduino
           to code the leds to make them light up in different ways, like flasshing in certain patterns.
       </p>
       <p>
           week 13 11/13 11/17
           This week we learned about business engineering. We learned about how companies use business engineering for UI and 
           advertisements. we then wathced shark tank pitces and started brainstorming on ideas for something for us to pitch like
           we are on shark tank. My group was brainstorming and we decided on a recyclinc can that is connected to an app that
           rewards you for recycling. The app gives you points and you can redeem those points for prizes.
       </p>

           week 14 11/27 12/1
           This week we talked about our buisnees engineering pitch. We presente infront of the class our product pitch. Ours went
           pretty well. I personally was a fan of one of the products called ¨scrub doggy¨. It was pretty much a brush for a dog with
           a dog toothbrush on the other end. We listened to everybodys pitch then asked questions.
       </p>

           week 15 12/4 12/9
           This week we had our bridge final. 
           <ol type="1">
  <li>our bridge weighted about 6-8 ounces</li>
  <li>our bridge held just under 3 cups</li>
  <li>our bridge held about half of its weight in water</li>
  <li>the middle of our bridge was the heviest, becuase it had the most spghetti there.</li>
  <li>the design of our bridge came from various bridges we saw online.</li>
  <li>our bridge did not exactly work how me wanted to becuase it broke alot as we were removing it from the paper </li>
  <li>the point of faliure was the ends becuase as it got removed from the paper, it got removed too hard and the edges broke</li>
  <li>we couldve made sure little glue got on the paper and focused more on supporting the sides of the bridge.</li>

       <p>Semester 2 week 2  1-5 1-19
       This week we did our project proposal for our mousetrap car. I researched articles and videos like one from mark rober.
       I found that different arm lengths can affect how your car moves and how far it will go. If the arm is shorter, it will go 
       faster but not as far. If the arm length is longer it wil go slower but a farther distance.
       </p>
       <p>Semester 2 week 3 1/22 1/26
       This week we worked on our mousetrap cars design. I made the car have a longer but not too long arm, so that it goes far but 
       not too slow and heavy. This week Im planning to complete the base and wheels of my car.
