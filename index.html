            8/20/23 - Today we did a project where we split the class in half and we all had cut in half pvc pipes.
            we had to stand together and hold together the pvc pipes in a line. We then rolled a marble down the line 
            and tried to get it about 20 feet then into a small plactic container. we had about 16 people, but ony 8 pipes
            so 8 people would line up with their pipes and once the marble rolled past their pipe, they would hand it to 
            somone that didnt have a pvc pipe so they could get in the line and help the marble roll to the container.
            If the marble stopped or rolled backwards, we would have to start over again. When the class got split in half,
            It meant that the 2 halves were 2 different teams and the first team to get the marble in the container wins.

            week 2 8/28 9/1
            This week we learned about how to use tinkercad, and about mechanical engineering. I like tinckercad so far.
            I think its fun to use 3d modeling and be able to create anything. We also started our home appliance or 
            furinature project, where we are gonna make a home appliance/furinature in tinkercad. We leared more about mechanical 
            engineering and how it works. We also started making our rube goldberg machine in tinkercad.

           week 3 9/5 9/8
           This week we worked on making a 3d model of a home appliance or furnature. I was thinking about making a fridge,
           but after a little tie working on it i didnt feel like making a fridge anymore. I then decided to make a couch.
           i started by placing a 3d rectanle, then cutting off some of it to give it a couch shape. I then shaved or the 
           corners of the couch to make it smooth and not sharp and blocky. I then used some math to divide the length of
           the seat area of the couch by 3 to know how long to make the couch cusions. I made the cusions then lifted everything
           up a little and added the legs. I then colored it a lightish brown and was done.

           week 4 9/11 9/15
           This week we worked on a rube goldberg machine. We started in tinkercad, making a draft of what we wanted to make. 
           The goal was to roll a baseball and have it end up popping a balloon. We started with rolling a baseball down 
           a ramp, then it curves then hits a mini car that rolls down a ramp, then stops on a tilting scale. Once it hits 
           the scale, the other side goes up wich has a needle on it wich pops a balloon. then we made it out of cardboard 
           and tested it and it worked.

           week 5 9/18 9/22
           This week we did 2 different engeneering challenges. The first one we did was we got one peice of paper anc had 
           to make a boat with it. We could fold the paper however we wanted. We aslo could use tape but only a litle. I 
           made mine into a bow type of shape. I taped the corners so no water could leak in.
