            8/20/23 - Today we did a project where we split the class in half and we all had cut in half pvc pipes.
            we had to stand together and hold together the pvc pipes in a line. We then rolled a marble down the line 
            and tried to get it about 20 feet then into a small plactic container. we had about 16 people, but ony 8 pipes
            so 8 people would line up with their pipes and once the marble rolled past their pipe, they would hand it to 
            somone that didnt have a pvc pipe so they could get in the line and help the marble roll to the container.
            If the marble stopped or rolled backwards, we would have to start over again. When the class got split in half,
            It meant that the 2 halves were 2 different teams and the first team to get the marble in the container wins.
